# Architecture

## Current repository structure

- `dfode_kit/cli/`: CLI entrypoints and subcommands
- `dfode_kit/cases/`: explicit case init, presets, sampling, and DeepFlame-facing helpers
- `dfode_kit/data/`: contracts, HDF5 I/O, integration, augmentation, and labeling utilities
- `dfode_kit/models/`: model architectures and registries
- `dfode_kit/training/`: training configuration, training loops, registries, and preprocessing
- `docs/agents/`: agent-facing operational and planning docs
- `tests/`: lightweight repository and harness tests

## Current refactor themes

### 1. Harness engineering
The repository now includes:

- `AGENTS.md`
- local verification commands
- lightweight CI
- documentation topology for agents and maintainers

### 2. Data contracts and workflow boundaries
A contracts layer is used to make HDF5 dataset assumptions explicit and testable.
The canonical `dfode_kit.data` package now also owns the main data-preparation boundary:

- HDF5 sampling outputs
- HDF5-to-NumPy conversion
- perturbation-based augmentation
- CVODE/Cantera labeling
- integration utilities used by downstream workflows

### 3. Config-driven training
The training stack is moving toward explicit config objects and registries so new model architectures and trainer types can be added without editing a monolithic training loop.

### 4. Agent-friendly CLI
The CLI now uses lighter command discovery and deferred heavy imports for improved usability in minimal environments.

## Architectural end state of the recent refactor

The repository has now completed the transition away from the older compatibility layout. In particular, these legacy layers are removed from `main`:

- `dfode_kit/cli_tools/`
- `dfode_kit/df_interface/`
- `dfode_kit/data_operations/`
- `dfode_kit/runtime_config.py`
- legacy `dfode_core` model/train compatibility packages

The current published docs should therefore treat `cli`, `cases`, `data`, `models`, `runtime`, and `training` as the only canonical implementation homes.
