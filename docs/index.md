# DFODE-kit

DFODE-kit is a Python toolkit for accelerating combustion chemistry integration with deep learning. It supports the end-to-end workflow of:

1. sampling thermochemical states from canonical flame cases,
2. augmenting and labeling datasets,
3. training neural network surrogates for stiff chemistry integration,
4. validating and deploying them in DeepFlame-based CFD workflows.

## What this docs site covers

- **Getting Started**: environment setup and installation
- **CLI**: current `dfode-kit` commands and their purpose
- **Canonical Case Initialization**: preset-based case setup with preview/apply/config workflows
- **Architecture**: repo layout and current refactor direction
- **Tutorials and Workflow**: how to think about the DFODE pipeline
- **Agent Docs**: operational guidance for coding agents and maintainers

## Project goals

The current development direction is to make DFODE-kit:

- easier for humans and coding agents to use,
- more reproducible for experiment workflows,
- more modular for new model architectures and training algorithms,
- more robust through contracts, tests, and CI.
